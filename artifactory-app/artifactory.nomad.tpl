## JFROG ARTIFACTORY SYSTEM CONFIGURATION FILE
## HOW TO USE: comment-out any field and keep the correct yaml indentation by deleting only the leading '#' character.
configVersion: 1
## NOTE: JFROG_HOME is a place holder for the JFrog root directory containing the deployed product, the home directory for all JFrog products.
## Replace JFROG_HOME with the real path! For example, in RPM install, JFROG_HOME=/opt/jfrog

## NOTE: Sensitive information such as passwords and join key are encrypted on first read.
## NOTE: The provided commented key and value is the default.

## SHARED CONFIGURATIONS
## A shared section for keys across all services in this config
shared:
    ## Security Configuration
    security:
    ## Join key value for joining the cluster (takes precedence over 'joinKeyFile')
    #joinKey: "<Your joinKey>"

    ## Join key file location
    #joinKeyFile: "<For example: JFROG_HOME/artifactory/var/etc/security/join.key>"

    ## Master key file location
    ## Generated by the product on first startup if not provided
    #masterKeyFile: "<For example: JFROG_HOME/artifactory/var/etc/security/master.key>"

    ## Maximum time to wait for key files (master.key and join.key)
    #bootstrapKeysReadTimeoutSecs: 120

    ## Node Settings
    node:
    ## A unique id to identify this node.
    ## Default auto generated at startup.
    #id: "art1"

    ## Default auto resolved by startup script
    #ip:

    ## Sets this node as primary in HA installation
    #primary: true

    ## Sets this node as part of HA installation
    #haEnabled: true

    ## Database Configuration
    database:
        ## Example for postgresql
        type: mariadb
        ## One of mysql, oracle, mssql, postgresql, mariadb
        ## Default Embedded derby
